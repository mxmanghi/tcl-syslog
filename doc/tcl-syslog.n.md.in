# SYNOPSIS

package require syslog

syslog::open ?-ident ident? ?-facility? ?-pid? ?-perror? ?-console?
syslog::close
syslog::log  ?-level level? ?-format message_format? message

syslog ?-ident ident? ?-facility facility? -pid? ?-perror? level message
```

Returns: nothing

# DESCRIPTION

This project provides a Tcl interface to the standard *syslog* service.
It implements a Tcl package that exports most of the functionalities of the
underlying syslog facility to the Tcl programming language. This includes
local and remote logging.

Syslog is a standard for forwarding log messages in an IP network. It is also
used to refer to the implementation of this standard and API, that supports
both remote and local logging. It is typically used for computer system
management and security auditing; usually to aggregate log messages in a
central repository. It is standardized within the Syslog working group of the IETF.

Syslog is available in all POSIX compliant and POSIX-like Operating Systems. The
Tcl command *syslog* creates the namespace syslog that exports 3 commands

- `-ident` *ident* is an optional string argument that is used by syslog to differentiate between processes and log contexts. It is up to the user to specify any string here. *This option causes the closelog to be called and the openlog

- `-pid` sets up syslog to print also the process pid in the log message. This options is most efficiently used as argument to 

- `-perror` prints the message also to stderr.

- `-facility` *facility* is an optional string dictated by syslog, and categorizes the entity that logs the message, in the following categories/facilities:

```
Facility    Description
auth        security/authorization messages
authpriv    security/authorization messages (private)
cron        clock daemon (cron and at)
daemon      system daemons without separate facility value
ftp         ftp daemon
kern        kernel messages
local[0-7]  local0 to local7 are reserved for local use
lpr         line printer subsystem
mail        mail subsystem
news        USENET news subsystem
syslog      messages generated internally by syslogd(8)
user        generic user-level messages
uucp        UUCP subsystem
```

The default facility is `"user"`.

`-level' *level* describes the severity of the message. In order to control the message level possible arguments are:

```
Priority    Description
emergency   system is unusable
alert       action must be taken immediately
critical    critical conditions
error       error conditions
warning     warning conditions
notice      normal, but significant, condition
info        informational message
debug       debug-level message
```

`-priority` the priority argument is equivalent to `-level` and it's kept for compatibility. It will be removed in future releases

# EXAMPLE

```tcl
package require syslog

syslog critical "Message 1"
syslog -ident tclsh warning "Message 2"
syslog -facility local0 notice "Message 3"
syslog -ident tclsh -facility user error "Message 4"
syslog -pid critical "Message 5.0"
syslog -pid -ident tclsh critical "Message 5.1"
syslog -pid -facility local0 debug "Message 5.1"
syslog -pid -facility local1 -ident tclsh info "Message 5.2"
syslog -pid -ident tclsh -facility local2 warning "Message 5.3"
```

Outputs in `/var/log/syslog` (syslog timestamps and line prefix removed):

```
tclsh: Message 1
tclsh: Message 2
tclsh: Message 3
testident: Message 4
tclsh[7049]: Message 5.0
my_ident[7049]: Message 5.1
tclsh[7049]: Message 5.1
my_ident[7049]: Message 5.2
my_ident[7049]: Message 5.3
```
